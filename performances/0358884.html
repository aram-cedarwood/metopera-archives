<b>Review 1</b>:<br><br>Review  in the Brooklyn Eagle <br> <p></p><p>Sunday night Concert</p><p></p><p>There was a great concert at the Metropolitan Opera House last night, although Pol Plançon, one of the popular favorites of these affairs, was ill and could not sing. Mr. Bispham sang Plançon's "Lost Chord" in a way which proved his effectiveness as a popular concert singer and some other songs of greater musical value like the fine artist he is. Young Huberman played a suite by Raff, which is admirably adapted to Sunday night audiences by its flowing melody and put into it the magnetism which had made him a success. He also played an obligato for Mme. De Vere, who sang the familiar "Ave Maria." The most successful number of the programme were three Wagner excerpts, in which Mr. Seidl infused immense spirit both on the part of his orchestra and the singers. One was the duet from "Flying Dutchman," by Miss Traubmann and Mr. Bispham, another the quintet from "Die Meistersinger" and the last the march from "Tannhäuser," which held the big audience in its seats until the last note was played.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Unsigned </p>
<b>Review 2</b>:<br><br>Review  in The New York Times <br> <p></p><p>THE SUNDAY NIGHT CONCERT</p><p></p><p>Much Applause for the Boy Violinist, Master Huberman</p><p></p><p>The leading feature at the twelfth Sunday night concert at the Metropolitan Opera House last evening was the performance of Master Huberman, the boy violinist. His playing evoked much enthusiasm, both in his solo rendition of "Suite," by Raff, and</p><p>in his accompaniment of Mme. De Vere in Gounod's "Ave Maria." Plançon was unable to appear on account of a severe cold, and Bispham, in addition to his own numbers, rendered "The Lost Chord," solo, and sang with Miss Traubmann the duet from "The Flying Dutchman," as well as taking the place of Plançon in the final number, the quintet from " Die Meistersinger," by Wagner.</p><p></p><p>In the second ballad of the fourth number, Loewe's "Erl Koenig," Bispham received great applause, as did also Miss Traubmann, when she rendered Verdi's "Caro Nome," being recalled five times. The entire programme was enthusiastically received, though at times the greater part of the audience manifested displeasure at the persistent applause which seemed to emanate from a few persons in remote portions of the house. Anton Seidl and Louis Saar were the conductors, Amhurst Weber, the accompanist, and Signor Baraldi, the organist. </p>
