<b>Review 1</b>:<br><br>Review  of W. J. Henderson in The New York Times <br> <p></p><p>Gounod's "Romeo et Juliette " was repeated at the Metropolitan Opera House last night. The fact that M. Jean de Reszke was to make his second appearance, as the unfortunate hero of the saccharine tragedy, was enough to call out a large and brilliant audience. The interest-or, perhaps it would be more accurate to say the curiosity-of the evening was further heightened by the announcement that the third of the six Juliettes in the company would appear. This Juliet was Miss Suzanne Adams, an American girl, who had not been heard previously in this city. The young lady was heard in Chicago when the company was there, and she was heard before that in London, whence the amiable cable brought pleasing accounts of her. Miss Adams made a favorable impression last night on a kindly audience. There is no denying that the disposition of our opera audiences is friendly toward young singers and, in the case of an American, this disposition is to be encouraged.</p><p></p><p>Miss Adams has a slight figure and a juvenile appearance, which are well suited to such parts as Juliet. Her voice is a very light and sweet-toned soprano. As far as could be judged last night, when the young lady was decidedly nervous, the voice is well placed; but in its emission she was uncertain owing to her lack of confidence. Sometimes the tones came out well, and at others they did not. She was occasionally a trifle flat, but that was to be expected in the circumstances. Her style was generally immature and undeveloped, and she has undoubtedly a great deal to learn. It does not at all follow that she will not learn it. But it ought to be said that she has not yet the skill or the experience to entitle her to a leading place in such a company as that now under Mr. Grau's direction.</p><p></p><p>M. Jean de Reszke's Romeo is not now in need of public description. Suffice it to say that the singer was in good voice last night, and his performance lacked nothing of its customary poetic fervor and eloquence. M. Edouard de Reszke was not in his best condition. Indeed, he has not been so this season, owing to an attack of grip from the effects of which his big voice has not yet recovered. But his Friar Laurence has dignity and weight at all times. M. Albers not having regained his health, M. Dufriche sang Mercutio perhaps quite as badly as it possible to sing it. It is an achievement to be superlative in some direction, at any rate. M. Plançon was the same dignified and stately Capulet whom we have known so long. The minor parts were in the usual hands. Signor Mancinelli conducted. </p>
