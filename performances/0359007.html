<b>Review 1</b>:<br><br>Review   in The New York Times <br> <p></p><p>THE OPERA HOUSE CONCERT</p><p></p><p>Mme. Eames, M. Saleza, M Plançon, and Mr. Bispham the Soloists</p><p></p><p></p><p>A combination of four popular singers at the Metropolitan Opera House last night was too much for the public. It could not stay away. There was a large audience. But if Mr. Grau continues to be so generous he may yet have to parade his famous "Huguenots" cast in order to get a profitable audience. The assembly of last night was in fine humor and was out for encores with the familiar zest. The four solo singers of the evening were Mme. Emma Eames, M. Saleza, the tenor; M. Plançon,</p><p>and Mr. Bispham. Mme. Eames chose to resurrect a very antiquated air from Gluck's "Armide" as her principal number. She sang it well, but it was not an air fitted to show either her voice or her style to the best advantage. But she was recalled, and she then gave the audience a treat of which it was perhaps not aware. She was clad in the jet-spangled gown which she wore at the Callender-De Forest musicale, and she sang one of the songs which she sang there - a song by Victor Harris, who accompanied her. She was heard afterward with M. Plançon in a duet by Faure, "The Crucifix," which had to be repeated.</p><p></p><p>M. Saleza sang a very pleasing aria from Ernst Reyer's "Sigurd," and sang it admirably. His second scheduled number was E. Gehli's "Le Voila Revenue." He delighted the audience, and had to give additional numbers, of course. M, Plançon, who was not in the best of voice, sang with fine skill and sentiment an aria from Meyerbeer's "L'Etoile du Nord." Mr. Bispham confined himself to songs with piano accompaniment. They were Schubert's "Who is Sylvia?" and "Hark, hark, the lark," Beethoven's "Die Himmel Rühmen," and Walter Damrosch's "Danny Deever." The orchestra played the overture to "Der Freischütz." the nocturne and scherzo from Mendelssohn's "Midsummer Night's Dream" music, and a Turkish march by Mozart. </p>
