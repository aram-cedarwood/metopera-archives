                            <br>A scheduled performance of Carmen was cancelled due to the illnesses of several singers on the roster who would otherwise have sung the title role. Le Prophete was suggested as a replacement, but Sofia Scalchi and the management could not agree on the arrangement and the opera house remained closed for the night.

<b>Review 1</b>:<br><br>The New York Times <br> MR. ABBEY AT HIS WIT'S END.<br><br> <br><br> THE DIFFICULTIES THAT PREVENTED HIS MATINÉE YESTERDAY. <br><br> <br><br> The opera of "Carmen," which was announced for the final performance of Mr. Abbey's season at the Metropolitan Opera House yesterday afternoon, was not given, and the house was closed, their money being returned to those who had purchased seats in advance. On Friday Mme. Trebelli was suffering from a severe cold, but she was so anxious not to disappoint the public that she sang on that evening. Yesterday morning her cold had developed to such an extent that she found it would be impossible to sing in the afternoon, and she at once notified Mr. Abbey. There was but one way out of the difficulty, and that was for Mlle. Louisa Lablache to sing Carmen, but she had already sent word that she was too ill to appear, and her mother had volunteered to sing Mercedes in her place. Under these circumstances the idea of producing "Carmen" had to be abandoned, as Mme. Sembrich had been ill all the week with a severe cold, Mme. Nilsson was but just recovering from a fever, and Mme. Valleria had sailed for Europe. <br><br> <br><br> There was but one resource in this emergency, and that was the substitution of an opera in which the star should be a contralto, and to arrange for this in time the assistance of Mme. Scalchi was indispensable. Mr. Abbey decided to give "Le Prophéte" and Signor Stagno was notified and consented to sing. Mme. Scalchi was sent for, but she returned word that it was impossible to sing, as she had not had her breakfast early enough. Mr. Copleston visited her at her hotel, and tried to induce her to sing by representing to her that Mr. Abbey was under contract to give 60 performances, and that unless she came to his aid he would be obliged to break his contract, but she was inflexible. Mr. Copleston says that her husband, Count Lolli, when Mr. Abbey's predicament was alluded to, shrugged his shoulders and said, Everybody for himself. Mme. Scalchi was finally induced to go to the opera house, and she volunteered to sing any rôle which was not so heavy as Fides, suggesting that a concert be given, or certain portions of other operas. Mr. Abbey refused to entertain this suggestion, stating that he would not end his season with a mutilated performance. Signor Campanini, although he was too unwell to sing in the "Stabat Mater" on Friday night, and nearly every one of the leading artists of the company came forward with offers of assistance in the emergency, but as it became evident that no satisfactory performance could be given, Mr. Abbey decided to close the house. The advance sale of tickets had not been very great, but there was a great rush of people at the doors, and the indications were that the house would have been well filled.
