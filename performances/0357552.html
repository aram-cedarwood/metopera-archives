<b>Review 1</b>:<br><br>Review  in the Philadelphia Press: <br> <p></p><p>It was, on the whole, an excellent performance. Madame Nilsson charmed all her hearers by her beautiful singing, and in the more dignified and tender scenes she was graceful and successful. She was somewhat too heavy and portentous in the sprightly scenes in Filena's dressing-room. In this scene she was warmly applauded, and, though she refused to accede to the demand for a repetition of the long scene, she was presented with a beautiful floral design and recalled three times. Madame Scalchi was, as usual, fully adequate to the occasion. Her rondo-gavotte was received with great enthusiasm, though its effect was injured in one place by the failure of the orchestra to make the retard in the accompaniment. Without wasting time, Madame Scalchi was gracious enough to sing it a second time. Mlle. Carni had an excellent opportunity to prove her ability, but it must be confessed that she did not meet the occasion. She had to be frequently prompted, and her performance was inadequate. She has a voice which has much sweetness, and will most likely improve, but its quality is thin and she does not always sing in tune. She did fairly well in the Polacca "Io son Titania," but it was commonplace and almost fell to the level of amateurishness. M. Capoul was remarkably successful. His acting is always refined, impassioned and graceful, and whatever the failings of his voice may be, he does not let the audience forget that is a true artist. His voice last night served him well, and he used it with such care that it showed little sign of wear to the end. Signor Novara sang his part very acceptably, and Signor Corsini threw considerable humor into his conception of Laerte. The chorus began in excellent shape, and though there was a falling from key in one or two places, their work was generally satisfactory. The orchestra was well handled by Signor Vianesi, who brought out the romantic beauty of the work with rare skill. </p>
