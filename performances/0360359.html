<b>Review 1</b>:<br><br>Review  in The New York Times <br> <p></p><p>PUCCINI'S "TOSCA" SUNG</p><p>Mme. Eames, Mr. Caruso and Mr. Scotti Appear in Familiar Roles</p><p></p><p>Puccini's " Tosca " was given at the Metropolitan Opera House last evening for the first time this season. It was substituted for "Rigoletto," originally intended for that evening, on account of the strike of the chorus and, though the strike came to an end, the appointment of " Tosca " remained. The change was perhaps not one to be deeply regretted for, though Puccini's opera may not enjoy so long a life as Verdi's, it has in it elements that make a greater effect in the more modern view of opera. It is not so successful as Puccini's "La Bohème" in its dramatic characterization through music; but it has much that holds and absorbs the attention, largely through the skill with which Sardou's drama has been adapted for operatic representation.</p><p></p><p>Mme. Eames as Tosca, Mr. Caruso as Cavaradossi, Mr. Scotti as Baron Scarpia are the principals in the cast, as they were last season. Mme. Eames has, of course, much improved her impersonation of the heroine since her first attempt several seasons ago: but It cannot be said even now to be a strongly dramatic one. Nor is Mr. Caruso's one of distinction. Mr. Scotti, on the other hand, as Baron Scarpia, presents one of the most polished and thoroughly consistent pieces of dramatic art that is to be seen here. There is excellent singing from all three of them. Mr. Caruso especially transported many of his listeners by his singing of his air in prison in the last act and as so often has been the case before, he was induced to repeat it. There was a very large and brilliant audience and the performance was received with evidences of approval.</p><p></p><p>Unsigned </p>
<b>Review 2</b>:<br><br>Review  in The Herald <br> <p></p><p>'TOSCA' SUNG BY SPLENDID CAST</p><p></p><p>Puccini's "Tosca" was the bill at the Metropolitan last night for the first time this season, with Mme. Eames in the title role, Mr. Caruuso as Mario and Mr. Scotti as Scarpia.  The anticipated fine performance, with this trio of artists on hand to repeat their well remembered embodiments of the principal roles, brought out one of the largest and most brilliant gatherings of the season. As a matter of fact, the performance was one of the most admirable that "Tosca" has ever had in New York.  Mme. Eames was in better voice than she has been before this season, and her acting in the great scene of the murder of Scarpia rose to great dramatic heights.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Caruso, too, outdid himself, his great aria in the last act being tumultluously redemanded by the house.  Of Mr. Scotti's powerful embodiment of Scarpia, all the best things previously said of it can be repeated. Mr. Caruso was in high spirits, especially in the first act when he caused Mme. Eames considerable embarassment by kissing her so realistically and persistently that the house broke out into a broad guffaw.  The prima donna blushed and struggled to escape the tenor's prolonged salute, but he had his way for the moment, to his own and everone's amusement, except Mme. Eames'.  </p><p></p><p>Things generally throughout the performancae went with spirit and finish, although at one point Mr. Vigna failed to do his full duty in the accompaniment of the principals, and came dangerously near spoiling the duo of the first act.  Mr. Rossi again did an amusing piece of work in the small buffo role of the Sacaristan.  Mr. Paroli and Mr. Dufriche were good, respectively,  as Spoletta and Angelotti, and Mr. Baillard sang agreeable the few lines of the turnky. </p>
