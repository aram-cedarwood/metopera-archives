<b>Review 1</b>:<br><br>Review  in The Mail and Express <br> <p></p><p>La Juive at the Metropolitan</p><p></p><p>The performance of "La Juive" at the Metropolitan last night had more of the character of a star performance than any other presentation given by Dr Damrosch's company this season. Frau Materna quite overpowered the rest of the cast, which was not the case last Friday when Frau Hanfstaengl took the part of Eudoxia, and the two prime donas, lifted some of the scenes to an unusual height of dramatic interest. Last night Fräulein Bely took Endoxia, and while she sang it with precision and neatness, the part dwindled down to insignificance compared to what it had been in the hands of the Frankfort singer. This was what might have been expected. Fräulein Bely is simply a light, graceful soprano. Frau Hanfstaengl is a dramatic soprano who possesses among many accomplishments the gift of singing lightly and gracefully as well as heavily and dramatically. Under the circumstances Fräulein Bely's task was most grateful, and she showed uncommon pluck and readiness to meet the exigencies of the season in assuming the rôle.?As we have intimated, whatever she did was directed by good judgment and musically correct. It is simply a matter of physical inability for her to fill the house with her voice, but she is never a disturbing element in a performance. The greatest falling off from Friday night was expected in the duet in the prison scene. But here Frau Materna's great voice and expressive action seemed to inspire Fräulein Bely, and the number was given with so much ardor by both singers that it was peremptorily redemanded.</p><p></p><p>Frau Materna's Rachel was on the same high plane as her performance of the part Friday night. While no doubt her dramatic singing in the finale of the first act and in the duet mentioned formed the most popular element of her personation, its value to us rests quite as much in the completeness with which she carries out every suggestion of composer and author. She gives a most harmonious, logical and consistent portrayal of the character, adapting voice and action to all its many and varied phases. A finer expression of fiendish triumph can hardly be imagined than that conveyed by the malignant smile which her face wears when she asks Leopold, when she has denounced him before his bride, if he has forgotten her - his Jewish mistress. Then, too, in her acting with Eleazar the bond of affection between father and child seems strengthened by the persecutions to which these unfortunates are subjected.</p><p></p><p>Herr Udvardy's Eleazar, capital on Friday night, was even better last night. It is a matter of congratulation that this artist, who always works with a good will and purpose, should at last have found a part thoroughly congenial to his voice, which, though not powerful enough?for the house, is very pleasant in quality. He phrased the unaccompanied prayer in the second act beautifully, and sang the famous aria with good effect. Herr Koegel's Brogni was conscientious and painstaking.?The lower register of this singer's voice is unfortunately seriously impaired and consequently in changing from this to the higher registers his singing appears uneven, spasmodic and explosive. Small as the part of Leopold is, it is still somewhat beyond Herr Schneller's capacity. </p><p></p><p>Frau Materna, we regret to say, has not yet fully recovered from her injury. She was progressing rapidly last week, but the rehearsal for "Don Giovanni" gave her a setback. At every performance she is obliged to subject herself for about two hours to massage treatment, and between performances naturally has to keep perfectly quiet. She naturally feels that she cannot do herself justice when on the stage. Her popular success, not withstanding this drawback, must be highly gratifying. For Saturday the house is sold out. </p>
