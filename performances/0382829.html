<b>Review 1</b>:<br><br>Review  and account of Funeral in The Evening Post: <br> <p></p><p>At 3 o'clock this afternoon, when the lobby doors of the Opera-house were thrown open, an immense crowd had assembled, a great many persons evidently having come without tickets in the hope of getting into the building with the crowd. At that hour the programme of services was as follows:</p><p></p><p>1. Organ solo, Mr. Seelyre.</p><p>2. Choral. "Passion" (Bach), "When I, too, am departed," Oratorio Society.</p><p>3. Address, Right Rev. Harry C. Potter, D. D.</p><p>4. Chorus (A. Weber). "Raseh tritt der Tod den Menschen," male chorus Metropolitan Opera House.</p><p>5, Address Prof. Felix Adler.</p><p>6. Siegfried Funeral March" "Götterdämmerung" (Wagner), orchestra of the Symphony Society.</p><p>7. Address Rev. Henry Ward Beecher.</p><p>8. Chorus, Passion music (Bach) 'Close to Thy Grave." Oratorio Society.</p><p> 9. Committal, Rev. William H. Cooke.</p><p>10. Choral, "St. Paul,", (Mendelssohn) "To Thee, O Lord, I yield my spirit."</p><p></p><p>It was yet uncertain at that hour, however, whether Dr. Potter, who was a director of the Oratorio Society, would be able to come, as he recently sprained his knee; as word had not been received to the contrary, his name was retained on the programme. Professor Adler telegraphed from the northern part of the State yesterday that he would start at once for New York, in order to speak at the funeral; but as it was not expected he could reach here in time, owing to the storm, arrangements had been made to have Herr Hock, the stage manager of the opera house, say something of Dr. Damrosch's earnest labor during the opera season just ended. Professor Adler arrived in New York by one of the early morning trains, and at once sent word that he would be present at the funeral. For many years Dr. Damrosch has directed the music at the services of the Society for Ethical Culture, of which Professor Adler is the head.</p><p></p><p>The arrangements for the disposition of the expected throng were made with great care. To personal friends of the Damrosch family were assigned the baignoir boxes on the north side of the house, and to the artists of the opera company the baignoir boxes opposite. The orchestra, numbering more than a hundred men, will occupy the front of the stage, with the members of the Oratorio Society behind them. Herr Lund will lead the orchestra, and Mr. Cortada the choral forces. The coffin will be borne from the hearse to the spot which Dr. Damrosch last occupied as leader by eight delegates from the Arion Society, at whose invitation the late musician first came to America. After the coffin will walk the delegates from the Oratorio and Symphony Societies, the Metropolitan Opera-house, Board of Directors, the opera company, and the Philharmonic and Arion Societies. Dr. Damrosch was at one time the conductor of the Philharmonic Society. The opera house is draped in black, and a catafalque has been erected where the leader's desk usually stands.</p><p></p><p>Owing to the late hour at which the services will end, it will not be possible to take the body to Woodlawn Cemetery this afternoon. This will be done tomorrow morning, when the relatives and personal friends will meet for the last services at the grave.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Illustration of Leopold Darmrosch's funeral in the opera house from Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper. </p>
